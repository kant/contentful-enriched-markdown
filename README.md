# Alex.js enriched Contentful Markdown editor

![Contentful Markdown editor with Alex.js validation](./screenshot.png)

This project is an example of the use of [Contentfuls App Framework](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/), [the design system Forma 36](https://f36.contentful.com/) and [Contentful's open source field editors](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/field-editors/).

These three tools build the foundation to enrich the Contentful UI.

**The Contentful App Framework** allows you to embed custom source code [in various locations](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/locations/).

**Forma 36** provides lots of React UI components that are ready to be imported in your project to look and feel like native Contentful UI.

**The open source field editors** allow you wrap and change existing components to create the editorial experience you need.

This project includes an example of an App that provides an enriched markdown editor.
